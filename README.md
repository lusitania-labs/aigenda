## Welcome to AIgenda: Your OpenAI GPT-Powered Personal Assistant

We're excited to introduce AIgenda, an open-source plugin designed to harness the power of OpenAI's GPT and transform it into a daily personal assistant. AIgenda is more than just a plugin; it's a platform that can be extended with additional plugins to perform a variety of specific tasks. Whether you need help managing your agenda, taking notes, sending emails, or even reading GitHub pull requests, AIgenda has got you covered.

But that's not all. AIgenda is developed in Kotlin, a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
Why Kotlin, you ask? Our goal is to attract JVM talent into the AI space, which is currently dominated by Python.
We believe that the JVM has a lot to offer in terms of performance, scalability, and type safety, and we want to make it easier for developers familiar with the JVM to get involved in AI development.

Join us on this exciting journey as we work to make AI more accessible and useful for everyone. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a Kotlin developer, or just someone who could use a little extra help managing your daily tasks, we invite you to try out AIgenda and see the difference it can make in your life.
