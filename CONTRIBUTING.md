# Contributing to AIgenda

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Aigenda. It's people like you that make Aigenda such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! 
It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

If you have a general question, creating an issue is fine.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork Aigenda and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 325-add-xyz-plugin
```

## Did you find a bug?
Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Implement your fix or feature
At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

## Merging a PR (maintainers only)

1. Branch was created from `main`.
2. Code that should be tested.
3. If you've changed APIs, documentation was updated.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
